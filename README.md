# MobileServiceProject

This was a course project to create a GUI-less java application to model the workflow of a billing system of a mobile service company in a simple way.

I learned about the following technologies:<br/>
  •	java<br/>
  •	classes, inheritence, interfaces<br/>
  •	static, static final lists<br/>
  •	collections: arraylist and hashmap<br/>
  •	comparator interface<br/>
  •	using lambda<br/>
  •	applied design pattern: visitor design pattern<br/>
  •	file handling<br/>
  •	stream API<br/>
  •	intellij idea
